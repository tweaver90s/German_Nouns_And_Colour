                <h1>Learn German Nouns With Colour</h1>
                <p>Associating a colour with each noun that corresponds to the gender of the noun creates a mnemonic link to aid memory of both the noun and the gender.</p>
                <p>This game forces you into remembering nouns and their gender by filling the screen with bright, unaviodable colour. Fluency is guarenteed in 2 hours of use.</p>
                <p>The word list is based on the 2800 most frequent nouns in the language, taken from <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1791231584">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Words are split up into 28 levels, each containing 100 nouns. Nouns in each level decrease in frequency.</p>
                <p>Once you're consistently getting 90-100% correct it's time to move to the next level.</p>
                <p>The images are AI generated and are, like, really weird sometimes. Also some were created using DALL-E-3 and others DALL-E-2 which makes things look even weirder.</p>
