                <p>Thanks for clicking this link! Here's a list of ways you can help:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Code</dt>
                        <dd>The codebase is in a pretty sorry state. Click the link to GitHub in the footer and suggest improvements.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Check Wordlist</dt>
                        <dd>
                            I'm not a native speaker and I got the list of words from a somewhat sketchy source, if someone could flick through the database and 
                            check that what we're playing with is accurate that would be a huge help.
                            The list of words can be found in 'Assets/Data/word_list.csv' when following the GitHub link at the bottom (the little cat thing).

                    <dt>Art</dt>
                        <dd>
                            As funny as I find some of the DALL-E generated art some of it really isn't fit for purpose. Please get in touch if you would like to 
                            create art, you won't be expected to work free of charge.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Donate</dt>
                        <dd>Keeping this live costs money and one day I won't be able to justify it. Any help is hugely appreciated.</dd><br>
